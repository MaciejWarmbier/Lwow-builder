# Lviv Tales
Lviv Tales is a city builder game full of events based on Ukrainian legends and folk tales. The players are encountered with several choices that will lead them to build the town of Lviv or make them flee from the Beast lurking in the woods, and leave their town behind. 

## Micro-manual:
To play the Lviv Tales game you only need a computer mouse or a touchpad and a keyboard.

  - Collect resources by clicking on the trees and stones. 
  - Press B to build the constructions to progress in the game.
  - Make the right choices during the events.
  - Make sure that your Morale stats are in a good shape - most of the events are brutal with that statistic.
  - If you need a break or want to start over - press P to pause the game and show simple menu.
