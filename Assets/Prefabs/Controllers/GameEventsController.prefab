    title: The Lake spirit
    description: Daniel was wandering around the nearby lake after nightfall. He
      was looking out for some dangerous creatures nearby, but all he could hear
      was a silent sobbing from the edge of the lake. He followed it until he saw
      a shimmering figure in the water plants.

        denied, but the creature couldn\u2019t hear him talking. She continued: \u201CWhy
        did you kill him!? He was my lover, the chosen one of my heart! I HATE YOU!\u201D 
        In a split second, the spirit attacked Daniel and wounded him badly. Daniel
        ran away in fear.   Daniel needed to be healed after that incident. Unfortunately,
